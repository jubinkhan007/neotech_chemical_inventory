# neotech_chemical_inventory

A new Flutter project.

## Repository notes

This codebase already contains the initial commit with the starter Flutter files.
Run `git log --oneline` to see the existing history and verify the baseline before
adding new changes.

## Pushing this project to GitHub

If you have not pushed this codebase to your own GitHub repository yet, you can do
so with the following steps:

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub (do not add a README, .gitignore, or
   license from the UI).
2. Set the GitHub repository as your `origin` remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   ```
3. Push the current branch (for example, `main`) to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

If the repository already has commits, Git will reject non–fast-forward pushes.
Use `git pull --rebase origin main` to bring in any remote changes before pushing
again, and configure a personal access token if prompted for authentication.
